## 🔧 Technical Deep-Dive Topics

### For Judges' Questions

**Q: How does federated learning work across hospitals?**
A: AWS SageMaker trains models locally at each hospital, only sharing model updates (not patient data) to a central aggregator. This ensures DISHA compliance while improving model accuracy.

**Q: How do you handle offline scenarios in rural areas?**
A: Progressive Web Apps with local-first architecture, AWS Wavelength for edge computing, and sync when connectivity is restored.

**Q: What's the cost breakdown for ₹50/patient/month?**
A: AWS free tier (₹20), serverless Lambda (₹10), IoT Core (₹5), storage (₹10), Nova models (₹5). Spot instances reduce ML training costs by 70%.

**Q: How do you ensure AI model accuracy for Indian medical context?**
A: Fine-tune AWS Nova models on Indian medical datasets, validate with AIIMS/PGI doctors, continuous learning from federated hospital data.

**Q: What's your ABDM integration strategy?**
A: Native FHIR APIs via AWS HealthLake, Health ID integration, HPR/HFR registry sync, UHI for service discovery, consent management via blockchain.

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Prototype Development**: Build MVP with Kiro.ai
2. **ABDM Sandbox Testing**: Validate integration with NHA sandbox
3. **Hospital Partnerships**: Pilot with 5 hospitals
4. **AWS Credits**: Apply for AWS Activate credits
5. **Regulatory Approval**: DISHA compliance certification
6. **Open Source Release**: Publish Swasthya SDK
